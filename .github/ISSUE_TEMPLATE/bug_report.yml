        This is the most important part of the bug report! Ask yourself “How can a developer reproduce this bug on their own computer?”
        First reproduce the bug yourself several times. If it is not reproducible every time you can still enter a bug mentioning the intermittent nature of the bug. This is explained very well [here](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)
